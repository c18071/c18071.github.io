<h2> Cement Mortar Cube Testing </h2>

<h2> Concrete Cube Testing </h2>

<h2> Accelerated Corrosion Test </h2>
</center>
<h4> Test Specimen and Instrumentation </h4>
(1) Concrete cylinder with Diameter-100mm, height -200mm in which a 16mm diameter steel bar (at least 30mm from the bottom of the cylinder which is centrally embedded) </br>
Note: coat with epoxy at the exit to eliminate crevice corrosion </br>
(2) DC power source (30V) </br>
(3) Stainless steel plate </br>
(4) Data logger - to determine the current variation with time </br>
(5) After casting the moulded specimen should be covered with a plastic sheet and left in the room for 24 hour </br>
(6) 5% NaCl solution </br>
Levelled mid-height of the cylinder </br>
(7) Steel bar - anode - connected to the positive terminal </br>
Steel plate - Cathode - connected to the negative terminal </br>
(8) The specimens are placed as below. </br>

(9) The corrosion process was initiated by impressing an anodic potential of 30V. (high voltage is used to accelerate the corrosion process and to shorten the test period) </br>
(10) The specimen is then monitored to see how long corrosion cracks take to appear on the surface. (data logger) </br>
(11) The current increases abruptly when the specimen is cracked, indicating the occurrence of cracking.
