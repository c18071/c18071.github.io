<h2> Aim </h2>
<h3> Evaluate the feasibility of using sea sand as a reliable alternative for river sand in the industry </h3>
<p> Our current exploration revolves around the potential viability of incorporating sea sand as a dependable substitute for river sand in concrete production. While the Sri Lanka Standards (SLS) have meticulously outlined guidelines pertaining to crucial properties like chloride content and shell content, there remains a notable research gap concerning the collective influence of these parameters on the overall durability of concrete. </br>

Interestingly, prior research has indicated that the introduction of manufactured sand (m-sand) tends to enhance the durability properties of concrete. This promising observation prompts us to consider an innovative approachâ€”blending m-sand with sea sand. By combining these two materials, we aim to investigate whether the synergy of their properties can further improve the overall durability of the concrete mix. </br>

Intriguingly, while SLS guidelines provide a solid foundation for individual property specifications, understanding the interconnected effects of multiple parameters on concrete durability is pivotal for optimizing our material choices. Through systematic experimentation and analysis, we endeavor to fill the existing knowledge gap, shedding light on how the intricate interplay of various factors contributes to the long-term durability of concrete structures. </br> </p>


<h2> Objectives </h2>
<h3> Evaluate the Performance of sea sand and m-sand based Concrete </h3>
<p> To date, there exists a notable absence of studies conducting a comprehensive performance evaluation that specifically considers the durability of concrete. Recognizing this research gap, our forthcoming investigation is poised to address this critical aspect. </p>
<h3> Find an optimum mix proportion based on workability, mechanical strength, and durability performance </h3>
<p> The integration of manufactured sand (m-sand) and sea sand in concrete mixtures has been the subject of numerous studies, focusing on properties like strength and workability. However, a notable gap exists in addressing the crucial aspect of durability. The absence of durability considerations in previous research raises concerns about the comprehensive performance evaluation of these blended sands. </br>

 </p>
<h3> Conduct a Lifecycle Assessment of sea sand and m-sand-based Concrete </h3>
<p> Of particular interest is the tendency in prior studies to advocate for higher proportions of m-sand without accounting for its potential environmental and cost implications. The production process of m-sand often involves energy-intensive methods, potentially contributing to environmental degradation and increased carbon emissions. </br>

In contrast, sea sand presents itself as a readily available alternative, yet its extraction requires careful management to prevent adverse effects on coastal ecosystems. To address these concerns and arrive at an optimal mix proportion, a more holistic approach is needed, considering durability performance, environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness. </br> </p>
